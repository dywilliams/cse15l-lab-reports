# CSE 15L Lab Report 1

## cd command
using the command with **no arguments**:
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1}$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```
directory at time of command: /home/lecture1

I got this output because using `cd` with no arguments takes you to the home directory. The output reflects this change with the absence of `/lecture1` in the prompt.
The output is not an error.


## ls command




## cat command
